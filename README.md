# MilkWidgetCore
A Widget Engine written in C++ and QT, to be cross platform and easy to create widgets on, hybrid Window/Widget apps.

ehhh i write up later. just compile with g++ -fPIC "main.cpp" -o gwidget_demo $(pkg-config --cflags --libs Qt5Widgets Qt5Core Qt5Gui Qt5Network Qt5X11Extras) -std=c++17. will use cmake soon. this is such an embarassment of a project
